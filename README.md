## Customization

### Adding New Issuers
Edit the `issuerData` object in the JavaScript section to add new issuers:

```javascript
const issuerData = {
  'TICKER': {
    name: 'Company Name',
    ticker: 'TICKER',
    sector: 'Industry Sector',
    creditScore: 800,
    // ... other properties
  }
};
```

### Modifying Metrics
Adjust the feature importance factors in the issuer data to reflect your credit model:

```javascript
features: [
  { name: 'Metric Name', value: 85, impact: 25 },
  // ... other metrics
]
```

### Styling Changes
Modify the CSS variables in the `:root` selector to customize the color scheme:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #your-color;
  --secondary-color: #your-color;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 70+
- Firefox 65+

- Data persistence is limited to browser local storage

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real financial data APIs
- User authentication and personalized dashboards
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for reports and charts
- Mobile application version
